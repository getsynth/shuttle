# Shuttle

[Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) is a Rust-native cloud development platform that lets you deploy your Rust apps for free.

Shuttle is built for productivity, reliability and performance:

- Zero-Configuration support for Rust using macro annotations
- Automatic resource provisioning (databases, etc.) via [Infrastructure-From-Code](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2022/05/09/ifc)
- First-class support for popular Rust frameworks ([Axum](https://docs.shuttle.rs/examples/axum), [Actix Web](https://docs.shuttle.rs/examples/actix), [Rocket](https://docs.shuttle.rs/examples/rocket), and [more](https://docs.shuttle.rs/examples/other))
- Support for deploying Discord bots using [Serenity](https://docs.shuttle.rs/examples/serenity)

üìñ Check out our documentation to get started quickly: [docs.shuttle.rs](https://docs.shuttle.rs)

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you have any questions, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/shuttle) server.

‚≠ê If you find Shuttle interesting, and would like to stay up-to-date, consider starring this repo to help spread the word.

## Shuttle Console

In addition to the CLI, you can also view your projects on the [Shuttle Console](https://console.shuttle.rs/)!

![console-preview](https://i.imgur.com/1qdWipP.gif)
*The GIF above visualizes the ease of adding resources to your project(s), along with how they are displayed in the console.*

## Getting Started

The `cargo-shuttle` CLI can be installed with a pre-built binary or from source with cargo.

Shuttle provides pre-built binaries of the `cargo-shuttle` CLI with every release
for most platforms, they can be found on [our GitHub](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases/latest).

On Linux and macOS, you can use this install script, which will automatically install the correct target for your OS and distro:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://www.shuttle.rs/install | bash
```

On Windows, you can use this install script to do the same:

```powershell
iwr "https://www.shuttle.rs/install-win" | iex
```

Our binaries can also be installed using [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall).
To install with `cargo-binstall`, run:

```sh
# cargo-binstall can also be installed directly as a binary to skip the compilation time: https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall#installation
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-shuttle
```

Although a bit slower, you can also install directly with cargo:

```sh
cargo install cargo-shuttle
```

> If installing cargo-binstall or cargo-shuttle fails, try adding `--locked` to the install command

After installing, log in with:

```sh
cargo shuttle login
```

To initialize your project, simply write:

```bash
cargo shuttle init --template axum hello-world
```

And to deploy it, write:

```bash
cd hello-world
cargo shuttle project start  # Only needed if project has not already been created during init
cargo shuttle deploy --allow-dirty
```

And... that's it!

```text
Service Name:  hello-world
Deployment ID: 3d08ac34-ad63-41c1-836b-99afdc90af9f
Status:        running
Last Updated:  2022-04-01T08:32:34Z
URI:           https://hello-world.shuttleapp.rs
```

Feel free to build on top of the generated `hello-world` boilerplate or take a stab at one of our [examples](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples).
