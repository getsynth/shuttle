# Auth service considerations

## JWT signing private key

Starting the service locally requires provisioning of a base64 encoded PEM encoded PKCS#8 v1 unencrypted private key.
The service was tested with keys generated as follows:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ED25519 -out auth_jwtsigning_private_key.pem
base64 < auth_jwtsigning_private_key.pem
```

Used `OpenSSL 3.1.2 1 Aug 2023 (Library: OpenSSL 3.1.2 1 Aug 2023)` and `FreeBSD base64`, on a `macOS Sonoma 14.1.1`.
